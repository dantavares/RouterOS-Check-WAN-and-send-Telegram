## This script should not be copied and pasted in its entirety, it should be copied and pasted into the terminal in blocks.

1. Define global variables with the necessary information. Wrong definitions will invalidate the script's operation!
2. Copy and paste the blocks as needed, if you don't know which blocks to copy, I don't know what you're doing here!
