# Blocks if someone keeps messing with a specific port, in this case it's 8291 and 22, change it as you wish
# If you fall into your own trap, don't despair, just knock on door 26969 and enter normally
# just don't take too long (1 minute), but only you can know that! I recommend you change it...
# Don't change the order of the rules, otherwise your Mikrotik will be possessed by an evil spirit!
# For IPv6, change "/ip" to "/ipv6" in the first line
# If you still get locked out, go cry at your mom's house for 10 days and try again

# Protected ports, separated by comma
:local ports "8291,22"

# Knock on the door if you are locked out
:local kport "26969"
